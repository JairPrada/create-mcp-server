## 📦 Project Structure

This template sets up a basic MCP server environment using modern TypeScript, ready for you to build contextual API services.

```

src/
├── index.ts        # Entry point of the MCP server
├── context/        # Define your contexts and resolvers
├── config/         # Configuration files (env, tokens, etc.)
...

````

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

To start working on your project:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
````

---

## 🚧 Development Workflow

To run the server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses `tsx` to start your MCP server in development mode.

---

## 🌐 MCP Inspector

To explore your context, test queries, and debug in real time, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

This will open a local interface in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:6274`) where you can interact with your MCP server without external clients.

---

## 🛠 VS Code Integration

You can run your MCP server directly from **VS Code** using the following command configuration (e.g. in a `launch.json` or devtools):

```json
{
  "mcp-server-starter": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-starter@latest"]
  }
}
```

Replace `"mcp-server-starter"` with your published package name if different.

---

## 📦 Deployment

To prepare your project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting provider or as a serverless function.

> 📝 Tip: Deployment strategy is left to the developer. You can deploy on Vercel, AWS Lambda, Docker, etc.
